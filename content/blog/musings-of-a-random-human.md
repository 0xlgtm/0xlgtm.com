A collection of lessons that I've learnt (the hard way lol) ever since I left my full time job with Kyber. In no particular order:

# Money
- Money is the most important asset when you cant fulfill your basic needs and wants.
- You are already a billionaire, a time billionaire.

# Health
- Health is wealth.
- Health is about preventive maintenance instead of corrective repair.

# Happiness
- Happiness is an emotion and emotions are fleeting. Aim to be content instead.
- Everyone makes mistakes. If you can't forgive, then you should choose to forget.
- Jealous is the root of all evil.

# Life
- Nobody is going to remember you except your kids.
- Life is all about making compromises.
- Life is hard enough so don't be too hard on yourself.
- There are only a few things in life that are truly irreversible.
- Avoid hyperoptimizing your time. Not everything is an opportunity cost.
- Curiosity driven living.
- Never forget the ones who helped you to get to where you are today and pay it forward. 
- A few deep & meaningful relationships is much better than many superficial ones.
- We can all agree to disagree.
- "Common sense" is different for different people.
- Listen to what your life is telling you instead of trying to force yourself to fit into the mould that society has created for you.

# Death
- You may very well die tomorrow so don't plan too far ahead into the future.

# Choice
- Always choose experiences over making more money.
- Too much self-help is worst than no self-help.
- Control the things that you can control and ignore those that you can't.
- Legacy is overrated.
- Innovation is for geniuses and losers.
- Instead of picking a goal in life, choose a way of life that you know you will enjoy.
- You don't know what you don't know so the only way to know is to try.
- If you've tried 10 different things and you still don't know what to do, you are obliged to find the 11th thing.
- Instead of writing down what you like to do, write down the things that you hate / cannot compromise on.
- Be the main character in your life.
- It's okay to float around if you're not sure of what to do. But you'll need to make a choice eventually and be patient with progress.
- Do what is right when no one is looking.
- Focus.
- If you don't ask, the answer is always no.
- If you don't try, you'll regret it in the future.
