Before we begin, let's talk about the elephant in the room â€” why write another gas optimization article when there are already [so](https://www.rareskills.io/post/gas-optimization) [many](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-gas-optimization) [resources](https://coinsbench.com/comprehensive-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-gas-optimization-in-solidity-5380db734404) [out](https://betterprogramming.pub/solidity-gas-optimizations-and-tricks-2bcee0f9f1f2) [there](https://0xmacro.com/blog/solidity-gas-optimizations-cheat-sheet/)?

My main criticism of these articles lies in their inclination towards breadth rather than depth. Specifically, they fall short in adequately explaining the technical details behind the optimizations discussed. Consequently, readers often resort to memorization and pattern matching instead of learning how to discern potential optimization opportunities.

In this article, we aim to address this gap by thoroughly exploring the most impactful optimizations, unraveling their intricacies to understand how and why they work. We will begin by covering the foundational knowledge necessary to grasp the techniques outlined later in this article. These techniques share a common underlying concept, making a solid groundwork crucial for a better understanding and appreciation of these strategies.

If you want to follow along the code examples, feel free to clone the [deep dives repo](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/). We will be using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) configured to Solidity compiler version 0.8.22 with optimizations enabled for 10,000 runs.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

### Understanding Opcodes

{% tip(header="Tip") %}
If you understand the SSTORE and SLOAD opcodes and their dynamic pricing algorithm, you can skip to the [optimization](#optimizations) section.
{% end %}

Assume that you are given the following [contract](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/blob/main/src/Storage.sol):

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract Storage {

    uint256 number;

    function store(uint256 num) public {
        number = num;
    }

    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){
        return number;
    }
}
```

In order to deploy it, we must first compile it to bytecode. We can use the `forge inspect` command to generate this contract's [runtime](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/32234/difference-between-bytecode-and-runtime-bytecode) bytecode:

`6080604052348015600f57600080fd5b506004361060325760003560e01c80632e64cec11460375780636057361d14604c575b600080fd5b60005460405190815260200160405180910390f35b605c6057366004605e565b600055565b005b600060208284031215606f57600080fd5b503591905056fea2646970667358221220f830518cc265c932d00bc09e305ea281ef5d24fe16cb6b04364d484451e3582164736f6c63430008160033`

To the untrained eye, this paragraph might appear nonsensical. However, it contains the code for the `Storage` contract. Each pair of [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) characters constitutes one byte, and each byte corresponds to an operation code (opcode for short) or arguments to the last opcode. For example, the first two pairs of hexidecimal characters are `60` and `80`. `60` stands for the `PUSH1` opcode and `80` is the argument for `PUSH1`.

Opcodes are the basic instructions executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and each opcode has a gas cost associated with it. In this article, we will focus on strategies that minimizes the use of two of the most expensive opcodes, namely `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`.

### Deconstructing SLOAD

#### What is the SLOAD opcode?

Given the index to some position in a contract's storage, the `SLOAD` opcode is used to retrieve the 32-bytes word located at that slot. For example, the ERC20 `balanceOf()` function executes one `SLOAD` operation to retrieve a user's balance. Unlike other opcodes with a fixed gas price, the `SLOAD` opcode has a dynamic pricing model as follows:

- 2,100 gas for a cold access
- 100 gas for a warm access

A cold `SLOAD` is 20 times more costly than a warm `SLOAD` so it is important to understand the distinction between a cold and a warm access if we want to take advantage of this.

#### Cold Access vs. Warm Access

Before a transaction execution begins, an empty set called the `accessed_storage_keys` is initialized. Whenever a storage slot of a contract is accessed, the `(address, storage_key)` pair is first check against the `accessed_storage_keys` set. If it is present in the set, it is classified as a warm access. Conversely, if it is not present, it is categorized as a cold access.

Let's demonstrate a cold and warm access with some [code examples](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/blob/main/src/ColdVsWarm.sol).

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract ColdAccess {
    uint256 x = 1;

    function getX() public view returns (uint256 a) {
        a = x;
    }
}

contract ColdAndWarmAccess {
    uint256 x = 1;

    function getX() public view returns (uint256 a) {
        a = x;
        a = a + x;
    }
}
```

The code snippet above contains two contracts, namely `ColdAccess` and `ColdAndWarmAccess`. The main difference lies in the `getX()` function of the `ColdAndWarmAccess` contract, which executes two `SLOAD` calls to storage slot 0.

The first `SLOAD` is considered a cold access and thus costs 2,100 gas. The second `SLOAD` is a warm access and costs 100 gas therefore, the difference in gas costs between the two `getX()` functions should be at least 100 gas.

{% tip(header="Tip") %}
The difference cannot be exactly 100 gas as additional operations are required e.g. reordering the stack.
{% end %}

We can generate the gas report using the `forge test` command with the `--gas-report` flag i.e. `forge test --match-contract ColdVsWarmTest --gas-report`. Executing this command reveals a gas cost of 2,246 and 2,353 respectively. As expected, the `getX()` function of the `ColdAndWarmAccess` contract costs 107 gas more!

### Deciphering SSTORE

If `SLOAD` is for reading a blockchain state then `SSTORE` is the opcode used to modify a blockchain state. Whenever a function wants to update the contract's storage, an `SSTORE` opcode is executed. For example, the `transfer()` function in ERC20 executes two `SSTORE` operations to update the balances of both the sender and the recipient.

The gas cost of `SSTORE` can be derived from this [algorithm](https://github.com/wolflo/evm-opcodes/blob/main/gas.md#a7-sstore) but for brevity, the key points are:

1) A storage update from zero to a non-zero value costs 22,100 gas*.
2) A storage update from a non-zero value to the same value costs 2,200 gas*.
3) A storage update from a non-zero value to a different non-zero value costs 5,000 gas*.
4) All subsequent writes to a slot which has been modified previously in the same transaction costs 100 gas.

<sub>* These are only applicable to the first write to a specific storage slot.</sub>

Based on the summary above, it is clear that the first `SSTORE` operation to a specific slot, also known as a clean write, is prohibitively expensive. For example, setting the values of two different slots from zero to non-zero costs 44,200 gas.

Let's walk through some [code examples](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/blob/main/src/SstoreCost.sol) to better illustrate the key points described above.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract ZeroToNonZero {
    uint256 public x;

    // Costs 20k + 2.1k gas
    // 2.1k is for the cold access
    function setX() public {
        x = 1;
    }
}

contract NonZeroToSameNonZero {
    uint256 public x = 1;

    // Costs 100 + 2.1k gas
    // 2.1k is for the cold access
    function setX() public {
        x = 1;
    }
}

contract NonZeroToDiffNonZero {
    uint256 public x = 1;

    // Costs 2.9k + 2.1k gas
    // 2.1k is for the cold access
    function setX() public {
        x = 2;
    }
}

contract MultipleSstores {
    uint256 public x = 1;

    // Since the compiler's optimization is turned on,
    // it knows to skip the first 2 assignments.
    // If you want to see the unoptimized cost
    // i.e. 2.9k + 2.1k + 100 + 100
    // turn off optimizations and run the command
    // `forge debug src/SstoreCost.sol --tc "MultipleSstores" --sig "setX()"`
    function setX() public {
        x = 4;
        x = 3;
        x = 2;
    }
}
```

The code snippet above contains four contracts, each corresponding to one of the four summarized points. Each contract contains a slightly different `setX()` function, which is responsible for updating the storage variable `x`.

Similarly, we can generate a gas report for this test using `forge test --match-contract SstoreCostTest --gas-report`. Executing this command reveals a gas cost of 22,238, 2,338, 5,138, and 5,138 respectively.

As expected, setting `x` from its default value of zero to a non-zero value the most expensive. Conversely, it is the cheapest when you try to update `x` to the same value. This is considered a no-op so you only need to pay for a cold access (2,100 gas) and a non-zero to non-zero storage update (100 gas).

Astute readers may notice that the cost for the `setX()` function of the last two scenarios is identical.This is because, with optimizations enabled, the compiler is smart enough to recognize that earlier assignments in the `MultipleSstores` contract can be disregarded. If compiler optimization is disabled in the foundry.toml file, you will able to see the additional gas costs arising from the multiple assignments.

As demonstrated in the examples above, the cost of executing the `SSTORE` opcode is exceedingly high, surpassing the costs of nearly every other opcode. This observation highlights a potential optimization opportunity: how can we minimize the use of `SSTORE`?

## Optimizations

As explained in the [Understanding Opcodes](#understanding-opcodes) section, our focus will be on gas optimization methods that can help with minimizing the use of `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`. These techniques comprise of:

- [Avoid zero values](#avoid-zero-values)
- [Storage packing](#storage-packing)
### Avoid Zero Values

[In the previous section](#deciphering-sstore), we learnt that updating storage from zero to a non-zero value costs a whopping 22,100 gas. However, this also extends to all [value types](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#value-types) and not just (un)signed integers. The "zero" value is more commonly referred to as the default value. For instance, the "zero" value for the `bool` type is `false`, and for the `address` type, it is `address(0)`.

A good example for implementing this optimization is for the reentrancy check modifier.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract AvoidZeroValue {
    uint256 public x = 10;
    uint256 public statusZero;
    uint256 public statusOne = 1;

    error Reentrancy();

    modifier reentrancyCheckUnoptimized() {
        if (statusZero == 1) {
            revert Reentrancy();
        }
        statusZero = 1;
        _;
        statusZero = 0;
    }

    modifier reentrancyCheckOptimized() {
        if (statusOne == 2) {
            revert Reentrancy();
        }
        statusOne = 2;
        _;
        statusOne = 1;
    }

    function subtractUnoptimized() public reentrancyCheckUnoptimized {
        x -= 1;
    }

    function subtractOptimized() public reentrancyCheckOptimized {
        x -= 1;
    }
}
```

In the provided [code snippet](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/blob/main/src/AvoidZeroValue.sol), there are two variations of the reentrancy check modifier. The unoptimized `reentrancyCheckUnoptimized()` modifier uses a value of zero, which is the default value for `uint256`, to indicate the unentered case. On the other hand, the optimized `reentrancyCheckOptimized()` modifier uses a value of one.

Generating the gas report with the `forge test --match-contract AvoidZeroValueTest --gas-report` command reveals gas costs to be 22,021 and 8,328 respectively. As we learnt previously, a non-zero to non-zero storage update is much cheaper than a zero to non-zero storage update so opting for a non-zero value as the unentered case in the reentrancy check will be more cost-effective.

### Storage Packing

Depending on your specific use case, you might not exhaust the entire range of values offered by a `uint256`. As such, you may want to consider packing multiple variables into a single storage slot.

Assume we that have the following problem:

> The students recently had four different exams and the school want to store their grades on a smart contract. The maximum grade for each test is 100.

The following [code example](https://github.com/0xlgtm/gas-optimization-deep-dive-source-code/blob/main/src/StoragePacking.sol) contains two solutions to solve this problem.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.22;

contract StoragePacking {
    // Naive implementation
    // mapping from student id => grade
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) gradeForA;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public gradeForB;  // Note: public variable so we can compare gas usage for single retrieval 
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) gradeForC;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) gradeForD;

    function recordGradesUnoptimized(uint256 id, uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c, uint256 d) public {
        gradeForA[id] = a;
        gradeForB[id] = b;
        gradeForC[id] = c;
        gradeForD[id] = d;
    }

    function getGradesUnoptimized(uint256 id) public view returns(uint256, uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        return (gradeForA[id], gradeForB[id], gradeForC[id], gradeForD[id]);
    }

    // Optimized implementation
    // mapping from student id => packed grades
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) grades;

    function recordGradesOptimized(uint256 id, uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c, uint256 d) public {
        uint256 packedGrades = (((((a << 64) | b) << 64) | c) << 64) | d;
        grades[id] = packedGrades;
    }

    function gradeForBOptimized(uint256 id) public view returns(uint256) {
        return grades[id] >> 128 & type(uint64).max;
    }

    function getGradesOptimized(uint256 id) public view returns(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c, uint256 d) {
        uint256 packedGrades = grades[id];
        a = packedGrades >> 192;
        b = packedGrades >> 128 & type(uint64).max;
        c = packedGrades >> 64 & type(uint64).max;
        d = uint256(uint64(packedGrades));
    }
}
```

A naive implementation uses a separate mapping for each subject. However, given that the maximum value for each grade is 100, it is possible to optimize storage usage by combining the grades into one uint256 value and using one mapping to store this value.

In order to do this, each grade is stored in adjacent 8 bytes "buckets". Although the maximum value for each bucket far exceeds 100, the design is more than sufficient to solve the given problem since we only need to store four grades per student.

While it is possible to use a smaller type like `uint32` to pack four grades, it is less gas efficient. As per the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html#:~:text=When%20using%20elements,the%20desired%20size.), the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

Bitwise operators like `|`, `>>` and `<<` are used to manipulate and ensure that the buckets have the correct size and are in the right position. Since Bit manipulation is not an optimization specific to Solidity, you should be able to find many good resources for it on the internet. However, if you want an article explaining bit manipulation using Solidity's syntax, this is my recommended [resource](https://medium.com/@mweiss.eth/solidity-and-evm-bit-shifting-and-masking-in-assembly-yul-942f4b4ebb6a).

{% tip(header="Tip") %}
Pack related variables together so you can retrieve and set them in a single operation.
{% end %}

Similarly, we can generate the gas report using the command `forge test --match-contract StoragePackingTest --gas-report`. From the gas report, we able to notice a substantial gas savings when comparing `getGradesUnoptimized()` against `getGradesOptimized()` and `recordGradesUnoptimized()` against `recordGradesOptimized()`. The gas difference of 6,430 and 66,473 aligns with our predicted savings because the optimized functions only use a single `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` compared to four in their corresponding unoptimized functions.
