A collection of lessons that I've learnt (mostly the hard way lol) ever since I left my full time job with Kyber. In no particular order:

# Money
- The value of money is inversely proportional to how much you have.
- You are already a billionaire, a time billionaire.

# Health
- Health is wealth.
- Long term preventive maintenance is always better than short term corrective repair.

# Happiness
- Pursue contentment over fleeting emotions like happiness.
- Jealous is the root of all evil. Social media is a highlight reel of life's happiness.

# Life
- Nobody is going to remember you except your kids.
- Life is all about making compromises.
- Celebrate your victories, no matter how small, and be kind to yourself.
- Avoid over-optimizing time; not everything is an opportunity cost.
- Embrace curiosity-driven living.
- Never forget those that helped you to get to where you are today and pay it forward.
- Few deep relationships are more valuable than many superficial ones.
- We can all agree to disagree.
- "Common sense" is different for different people.
- Listen to your life instead of conforming to societal expectations.
- Life is full of ups and downs. Having experienced "down" is the only way to truly appreciate "up".

# Death
- You may very well die tomorrow so live in the present and don't plan too far ahead into the future.

# Choice
- Prioritize experiences over money.
- Self-help is like a drug, don't be addicted to it.
- Less is more. Focus.
- Control what you can; ignore the rest.
- Legacy is overrated.
- Innovation is for geniuses and losers.
- Don't waste your time doing things that won't help you to achieve your goal.
- If you don't have a goal in life, consider choosing a way of life that you know you will enjoy.
- You don't know what you don't know so the only way to know is to try.
- If you've tried 10 different things and you still don't know what to do, it is your responsibility to find the 11th thing.
- Instead of trying to find something you like to do, focus on avoiding something you hate / cannot compromise on.
- Be the main character in your life.
- It's okay to float around if you're not sure of what to do. But you'll need to make a choice eventually and be patient with progress.
- Do what is right when no one is looking.
- If you don't ask, the answer is always no.
- If you don't try, you'll regret it in the future.
- There are only a few things in life that are truly irreversible.
- Live with the consequences of your action.

# Luck
- Hard work is often mistaken for luck.
