A collection of lessons that I've learnt (mostly the hard way lol) ever since I left my full time job with Kyber. In no particular order:

# Money
- The value of money is dependent on how much money you have. The more you have, the lesser it's worth.
- You are already a billionaire, a time billionaire.

# Health
- Health is wealth.
- Long term preventive maintenance is always better than short term corrective repair.

# Happiness
- Happiness is an emotion and emotions are fleeting. Aim to be content instead.
- Jealous is the root of all evil. Social media is a curation of the best parts of life.

# Life
- Nobody is going to remember you except your kids.
- Life is all about making compromises.
- Life is hard enough so don't be too hard on yourself. Remember to celebrate your wins, no matter how small.
- Avoid hyperoptimizing your time. Not everything is an opportunity cost.
- Curiosity driven living.
- Never forget the ones who helped you to get to where you are today and pay it forward. 
- A few deep & meaningful relationships is much better than many superficial ones.
- We can all agree to disagree.
- "Common sense" is different for different people.
- Listen to what your life is telling you instead of trying to force yourself to fit into the mould that society has created for you.
- Life is full of ups and downs. Having experienced "down" is the only way to truly appreciate "up".

# Death
- You may very well die tomorrow so don't plan too far ahead into the future.

# Choice
- Always choose experiences over making more money.
- Too much self-help is worst than no self-help.
- Less is more. Focus.
- Control the things that you can control and ignore those that you can't.
- Legacy is overrated.
- Innovation is for geniuses and losers.
- You're going to be spending the bulk of your life working so do what excites you.
- Don't waste your time doing things that won't help you to achieve your goal.
- Instead of picking a goal in life, choose a way of life that you know you will enjoy.
- You don't know what you don't know so the only way to know is to try.
- If you've tried 10 different things and you still don't know what to do, it is your responsibility to find the 11th thing.
- Instead of writing down what you like to do, write down the things that you hate / cannot compromise on.
- Be the main character in your life.
- It's okay to float around if you're not sure of what to do. But you'll need to make a choice eventually and be patient with progress.
- Do what is right when no one is looking.
- If you don't ask, the answer is always no.
- If you don't try, you'll regret it in the future.
- There are only a few things in life that are truly irreversible.
- You have to live with the consequences of your action.
- People often mistake hard work for luck.
