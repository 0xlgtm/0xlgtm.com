Hi there üñêÔ∏è

My name is Simon but some of you may recognize me as 0xlgtm.

I spend the majority of time tinkering with assembly and writing about my experiments and insights. Occasionally, I also participate in bug bounties, smart contract audits and CTFs.

You can read my articles at my [blog](./blog).

I am also actively looking for new and interesting opportunities. Feel free to reach out on twitter if you are interested in engaging my services.
