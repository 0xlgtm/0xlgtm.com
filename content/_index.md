Hi there 🖐️

My name is Simon but some of you may know me better as 0xlgtm.

I specialize in assembly optimization and security research.

You can read about my insights and discoveries on my [blog](./blog).

I am also actively looking for new and interesting opportunities. Feel free to reach out on twitter if you are interested in engaging my services.
