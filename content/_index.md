Hi there üñêÔ∏è

My name is Simon but some of you may recognize me as 0xlgtm.

Most of the time, you can find me trying to poke holes at vulnerable protocols.

But when I'm not doing that, I enjoy [writing](https://0xlgtm.com/blog/) and sharing about my learnings and helping others.

I am also actively looking for new and interesting opportunities.

Feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xlgtm) if you are interested in engaging my services.
