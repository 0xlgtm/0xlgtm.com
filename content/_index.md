Hi there üñêÔ∏è

My name is Simon but some of you may recognize me as 0xlgtm.

Most of the time, you can find me trying to poke holes at vulnerable protocols. I also enjoy [writing](https://0xlgtm.com/blog/), sharing my learnings and helping others.

I am actively looking for new and interesting opportunities. Feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xlgtm) if you are interested in engaging my services.
